# Advanced-Customer-Segmentation-using-Machine-Learning
"The customer data in our Customer Segmentation project, which is included in the entry and intermediate level projects, was simple and the K-Means clustering algorithm was sufficient for segmentation."

Customer Segmentation using AI
This project groups customers into different segments based on their age, income, spending habits, gender, and region. It helps businesses understand customer behavior and create targeted marketing strategies.

How It Works
Create Sample Customer Data

Generates 2000 customers with random Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, Gender, and Region.
Saves the data as customer_data.csv.
Prepare the Data

Separates numerical (Age, Income, Spending Score) and categorical (Gender, Region) data.
Converts everything into a format AI models can understand.
Reduce Complexity

Uses UMAP (a smart technique) to simplify the data while keeping important details.
Group Similar Customers (Clustering)

HDBSCAN: Identifies natural groups based on behavior.
GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model): Another method to classify customers probabilistically.
Visualize & Save Results

Plots a graph to show how customers are grouped.
Saves the final customer segments as customer_segmented.csv.
Why This is Useful?
Helps businesses understand different customer types.
Allows targeted marketing and personalized recommendations.
Reduces cost by focusing on the right customer segments.
Now you have AI-powered customer segmentation in action.
